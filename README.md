This is my submission for JetBrains' RubyMine Internship for the summer of 2022.
- `task.java` is the code that I received,
- `task_but_it_actually_compiles.java` is well... what the name suggests. I had to fix some syntax,
- `my_submission.java` is my own implementation of the given methods,

The answers to the questions I received are in `answers.ipynb`.
