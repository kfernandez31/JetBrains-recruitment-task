    "- For the sake of readability, I renamed `solve()`'s argument `k` to `r`.\n",
    "- When referring to `help()`'s complexity, I'll use:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  where $n:=$`vals.size()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve()` method iterates over all $r-l+1$ values of `i`, calling `help()` with every `i` as its 2nd argument, outputting a list in every iteration. The result is thus a list of lists and solve's time and memory complexities are respectively:\n",
    "$$O(solve) = O((r-l+1)\\cdot O(h(k,n)))$$\n",
    "$$O_{mem}(solve)=O((r-l+1)\\cdot O_{mem}(h(k,n)))$$\n",

    "- $L=[a_0,\\ldots,a_{n-1}]$ : a list of length $n$,\n",
    "- $()$ : an empty tuple, $(j_1,\\ldots,j_{k-1})$ : a tuple of length $k-1$  satisfying $\\forall_{i=1,...,k-2} j_i<j_{i+1}$\n",
    "-  $L[i,...,n-1]$ : a suffix of list $L$ from index $i$ to $n-1$,\n",
    "-  $@$ : symbol of concatenation of two lists, $\\sum^{@}$ : sum in the sense of concatenation,\n",
    "-  $\\odot$ : operator that when applied as:\n",
    "   $$(j_1, \\ldots, j_{k-1})\\odot L[j_{k-1}+1,...,n-1]$$\n",
    "    outputs the given suffix with every element multiplied by $\\prod_{i=1,\\ldots,k-1}L[j_i]$. If the left operand is $()$, it results in identity. If the right operand is $[]$ (an empty list), the result is also $[]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example provided, we have $n=3$, $L=[2,5,1]$ (meaning `vals`) and $k=1,...,5$. We obtain:\n",

    "- for $k=2$: \n",
    "$$((0)\\odot L[1,2]) @ ((1)\\odot L[2]) @ ((2)\\odot []) = $$\n",
    "$$=((0)\\odot L[1,2]) @ ((1)\\odot L[2])= [5,10,2]$$\n",
    "We can see that any tuple with $i_{k-1}=n-1$ will yield an empty list in the $\\odot$ operation. With conciseness in mind, I will omit empty lists further below.\n",
